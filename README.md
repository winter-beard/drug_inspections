# drug_shortages
Looking at FDA drug shortages, using D3 to animate scrollytelling.

Aim: I initially wanted to use D3 to make all my graphs but quickly settled for Flourish with D3 coding. I made the third graph largely in Illustrator off a Flourish timeline and was able to practice highlighting elements as you scroll using D3. 

Had also wanted to look closer at the drug supply chain for these drugs but found it really hard to get good data, and though I did a significant amount of analysis on FDA inspection data in my notebook, I will have to work on tying it to specific shortages later, as there was no way for me to know which addresses were producing which drug, something I hope to FOIA from the FDA in the future. Hence the misleading repo title.
