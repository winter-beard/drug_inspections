				<div class="prose-container">
	 			<p>In America, 70% of cancer centers are reporting a shortage of Cisplatin, a platinum-based oncology drug used particularly in soft tissue cancers and flagged for pediatric use. <a href = "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29789926/">A 2018 hospital study</a> has shown that nearly 50% of chemotherapy patients receive a platinum drug during their cancer treatment, and some patients receive two, and even three, different platinum drugs. Cisplatin has been used since the 1970s in cancer treatment is sometimes referred to as the "penicillan of cancer drugs". Soft tissue cancers especially, breast, colon and bladder that see some of the highest impacts to mortality risk if treatments are delayed. <a href = 'https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4087'>One medical review</a> estimated a 20% increase in mortality risk with just four weeks of delay.</p> 
				<img src = "Pharmez.png" alt = "a screenshot from Googlemaps of a industrial facility with signage 'Intas Pharmaceuticals'".></img>
				<p>About 50% of the US' Cisplatin comes from a privately-owned Indian company called Intas Pharmaceuticals, manufacturing both finished injectibles and the active ingredient.</p> 
				<p>The current shortage began three months after the FDA found massive failures at Intas' newest facility, Pharmez compound near a village called Matoda. Here, 5 million injectible drugs, many of them cancer treatments and 1 billion solid doses of pharmaceuticals are made every year.It's one of only four FDA-approved Cisplatin-producing facilities, and manufactures an estimated 50% of the US market for Cisplatin, 20% of the US' Carboplatin imports, and 50% of its Methotrexate. Part of the reason the manufacturing marketshare is so concentrated in Intas is because most companies want little to do with the dangers of the raw platinum compounds and the thin profit margins from a drug that costs less than $50 a vial compared to thousands of dollars for doses of newer, advanced immunotherapies.</p>
				<p>A December 2022 report the FDA, found factory staff destroying quality control documents with acid on the property and revealed the company was consistently miscounting the viable compounds of the chemotherapy injectible that was present in their cultures.      
				<img src="timeline_creative-Artboard_1.jpg" alt="a pic of the facility with a timeline of the Cisplatin shortage over the top, it shows that the drug was in shortage from 2017 to 2019 and from March 2023 to present."></img>
				<p>The FDA's investigating officer concluded there was no way to assure the public that previous batches of the drug were at the potency advertised, and in June, 2023 the company was issued with an Import Alert, preventing them from shipping products to the US, except for critical medicines which would undergo additional quality assurance screening. </p>

While the number of inspected facilities remained constant in other countries over the last three years. Compared to 2021, there have been 130 more API manufacturing facilities inspected in India in 2023.</p>
